## Project structure

`main` brach contains all code examples and personal user directories

`/tasks` - code examples structured as `/tasks/task_1/`, `/tasks/task_2/`, etc.

User directories have name pattern `/[username]_code`

## Development

Personal tasks should be implemented in `/[username]_code/task_1/`, `/[username]_code/task_2/`, etc.

Each personal task should be implemented in new branch forked from `master` and merged back after review

If you are using Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab) you need to export code to `*.py` file so automatic style checker would be able to map errors to row position

## Code style

This project follows [PEP8 standard](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with automatic style verification
